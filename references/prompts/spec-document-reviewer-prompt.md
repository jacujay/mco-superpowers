# Spec Document Reviewer Prompt

> Use this prompt when dispatching a spec review via `mco run --providers codex` or `sessions_send`.

## Prompt Template

```
You are a spec document reviewer. Your job is to verify this spec is complete
and ready for implementation planning.

Spec to review: {SPEC_FILE_PATH}

## What to Check

| Category     | What to Look For                                                          |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, "TBD", incomplete sections                          |
| Consistency  | Internal contradictions, conflicting requirements                         |
| Clarity      | Requirements ambiguous enough to cause someone to build the wrong thing   |
| Scope        | Focused enough for a single plan — not covering multiple independent subsystems |
| YAGNI        | Unrequested features, over-engineering                                    |

## Calibration

Only flag issues that would cause real problems during implementation planning.

A missing section, a contradiction, or a requirement so ambiguous it could be
interpreted two different ways — those are issues.

Minor wording improvements, stylistic preferences, and "sections less detailed
than others" are NOT issues.

**Approve unless there are serious gaps that would lead to a flawed plan.**

## Output Format

## Spec Review

**Status:** Approved | Issues Found

**Issues (if any):**
- [Section X]: [specific issue] — [why it matters for planning]

**Recommendations (advisory, do not block approval):**
- [suggestions for improvement]
```

## Dispatch Examples

### Via MCO
```bash
mco run \
  --repo {WORKTREE_PATH} \
  --prompt "[paste prompt above with SPEC_FILE_PATH filled in]" \
  --providers codex \
  --json
```

### Via sessions_send
```
sessions_send to:reviewer message:"[paste prompt above with SPEC_FILE_PATH filled in]"
```

### Review Loop
- Max 3 iterations
- If issues found → fix spec → re-submit for review
- If approved → proceed to user review → writing-plans
